# Mojaloop Integration

Mojaloop is a Real Time Payment (RTP) system that fundamentally bridges the communication between
Financial Service Providers (FSPs) to perform financial transactions. With Mojaloop as an intermediary,
moving money between FSPs becomes simpler as each participant, in this case an FSP, only needs to
conform to the Application Programming Interface (API) defined by Mojaloop in order to be able to
communicate with other participants. Figure 1 shows a common problem with the traditional method
to transfer money between FSPs where each participant typically defines their own set of API and
introduce a complex process of synchronization between each pair of FSPs. Meanwhile, as shown in
Figure 2, each participant could focus to ensure that it maintains a proper communication with
Mojaloop to be able to talk with other participants in the RTP network.

As RTP system like Mojaloop grows in popularity, the use of third-party services who do not manage
its own ledger but exist for the purpose of initiating transactions has also come into attention.
With Mojaloop, a PISP also enjoys the benefit of the FSPs where it does not need to mantain multiple
APIs to communicate with each FSP but only a single API that follows Mojaloop's standard. Figure 3
shows how a PISP could simultaneously setup communication with multiple FSPs by integrating to the
Mojaloop's RTP network.

In order to join a Mojaloop network, a PISP must complete the following steps:

1. [Certificate Registration](#certificate-registration)
2. [URL Registration](#url-registration)

In general, all of the signing, encryption, and other setup required to make requests to Mojaloop
are expected to be handled by the [`sdk-standard-components`](https://github.com/mojaloop/sdk-standard-components)
libary. Hence, PISP demo server only needs to set the proper configuration such as the path to the
issued certificate, Mojaloop's URL, PISP identifier, transport scheme, and various other options
which could be found [here](https://github.com/mojaloop/sdk-standard-components/blob/master/src/lib/requests/baseRequests.js).

## Certificate Registration

In the Mojaloop RTP Network, every participant must be registered and have a
signed certificate by the centralized Certificate Authority (CA). According to the
[PKI Best Practices](https://docs.mojaloop.io/mojaloop-specification/documents/PKI%20Best%20Practices.html),
the CA itself will have a self-signed root certificate for signing the participants' certificates.
The certificates are important to protect the transport-level communication (TLS) and application-level
communication (JWS and JWE). All of the security protocols involved are for the purpose of ensuring
integrity and confidentiality between platforms. More information could be found in the
[Mojaloop Specifications](https://docs.mojaloop.io/mojaloop-specification/).

PISP has to register its certificate manually, by telling the operator of Mojaloop the PISP's public
key and getting the certificate digitally signed by the centralized CA.

## URL Registration

As Mojaloop's architecture follows the asynchronous request/response design pattern, PISP demo server
also interacts with Mojaloop using that pattern to avoid long-running connections. When making a
request to Mojaloop, it may take some time to receive the response as everything is considered to work
asynchronously. Even though it takes only several seconds on average, we still need to prepare for the
indefinite time characteristic of asynchronous messages. As a result, PISP demo server needs to register
its URL so that Mojaloop knows where to make the callback once the reply is ready. For example,
Mojaloop needs to know the endpoint that is ready to handle `PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}` callback from Mojaloop
following a previous request of `GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}` by the PISP server to perform a party lookup.

The following are the callback URLs that need to be registered by the PISP demo server:

- `PUT /participants`
- `PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}`
- `PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}/error`
- `PUT /consentRequests/{ID}`
- `PUT /consentRequests/{ID}/error`
- `POST /consents`
- `PUT /consents/{ID}`
- `PUT /consents/{ID}/error`
- `POST /authorizations`
- `PUT /transfers/{ID}`
- `PUT /transfers/{ID}/error`

For each callback endpoint, PISP demo server needs to register the URL to Mojaloop's switch by
sending a request with the following format:

```txt
  POST {HOST_URL}/participants/{PISP_IDENTIFIER}/endpoints

  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "type": "{TYPE_ENUM}",
    "value": "{PISP_ENDPOINT}"
  }
```

- `HOST_URL`        : URL of the Mojaloop service for which the PISP wants to register its endpoint.
- `PISP_IDENTIFIER` : An identifier for the PISP that is registered in Mojaloop. This value is expected
                      to be decided when a PISP registers its certificate in Mojaloop and stay the same
                      over period. Example: `pisp`.
- `TYPE_ENUM`       : An enumeration type of the callback endpoint that is defined by Mojaloop.
- `PISP_ENDPOINT`   : The endpoint of the PISP that is ready to handle the callback. This may also contain
                      some wildcard for path parameters.

### Run A Script To Register All of The URLs

For convenience, there is a script provided in this repository to register all of the URLs described above.

Currently, there are three only three options that are required to run the script:

- `-h` or `--host`: Host name for the pisp, which includes the transport protocol. The host name will be
  appended with the endpoint paths that are specified on the Mojaloop OpenAPI specification. For example,
  if the host is "https://example.com" and there is an endpoint with path "/participants", then it means
  the PISP needs to serve the following endpoint: "https://example.com/participants".
- `-p` or `--participant-id`: Participant ID of the PISP that is registered in Mojaloop.
- `--ml-central-ledger`: Host name of the central ledger service in Mojaloop, which is currently needed
  to register all of the endpoints described above. The value should also include the transport protocol.
  PISP endpoints that are related to the service will be registered by sending the registration object
  to the given address. Example: "https://central-ledger.local".

You can execute the code using the npm script `register-url`. For example, you can try to enter the
following command in the terminal when you are located at the root directory of this project:

```txt
npm run register-url -- -h https://pisp-demo-server.local -p pisp \
  --ml-central-ledger https://central-ledger.local
```

Notice that `--` is used here, which is a special argument to make the provided arguments available for the
underlying script execution.
