        birth certificate number, and national registration number. The

        identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company) is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier
        can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific

        should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric

        be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system. The ALIAS
        identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined by the PartyIdentifier.
